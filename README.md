# Problem Description
- description of the whiteboard erasing problem
- link to the industrial application of concrete scraping

# Minimum Viable Product Description
1. Erase a perfectly oriented whiteboard with bimanual coordination
  - classify a board as dirty
  - identify the dirty areas of the board
  - use orientation of dirty areas to decide between left or right dominant asymmetric motions
  - grab board with one hand, erase with other
  - confirm that board has been cleaned

**Possible Future Work**
2. Start with a skewed board and orient in space
3. Introduce more functionality into erasing specific areas or characters on the board
