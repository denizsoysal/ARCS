# General and Control

- have human like movement
    - one hand to hold the whiteboard, the other hand to erase 
    - or two hands to erase
    - will need a specific eraser if we want to erase only specific character
    - we will need to have cues to know when to start erasing 
        - for example with motion detect when the whiteboard moves, or when we show some color or stuff 
- if the whiteboard is out of the work space of the arm, you can grab it to make it closer to your workspace 
- design a specific grasper to grasp the whiteboard
    - maybe also design a specific eraser  

# Perception 

- need to localize the whiteboard, start and ends 
    - localize grasping region of the whiteboard 
- where to put the camera (on the arm or fixed on the base)
- first just recognize location of simple dots and plan a trajectory between them 
- what to recognize to erase
    - letters, digits, ... 
    - letters in words, or with spacing between letters 


# Steps to follow 

- first step
    - localize the board in 6D
        - localize the top to grasp
    - being able to control the arm 
        - look to what Federico has done 
        - follow a trajectory while applying some forces (e.g. apply force on the table)
